Description
-----------

-   QuAX-DaF stands for **Qu**antitative **A**nalyse von Te**X**ten für **D**eutsch **a**ls **F**remdsprache ("Quantitative Analysis of Texts for German as a Foreign Language").
-   QuAX-DaF is an interactive web application that analyzes words in texts, compares their frequency distribution to German language use, and generates teaching material for exercises at specific proficiency levels.
-   QuAX-DaF will be of use to teachers of German as a foreign language and developers of teaching material.

A detailed documentation in German including linguistic background and suggestions for exercises is available [here](https://daniel-jach.github.io/quax-daf/documentation/quax-daf-documentation.pdf).

QuAX-DaF is available for use [here](https://danieljach.shinyapps.io/quax-daf/).

The application is written in *R* (R Core Team 2013) and uses *shiny* (Chang et al. 2020) and *TreeTagger* (Schmid 1994).
